# Welcome to Cyber Security Basics!

This is a list of Cyber Security Best Practices and examples of threats seen "in the wild"




# Seen in the Wild

Facebook

1. My grandma friended me again with a second account using the same picture.
 - Bad actors will copy a profile picture and name to try and friend the victim's friends. They may
 slightly alter the profile picture to not be screened as using the same exact picture. 

 - "She" said she was in a car accident and needed me to send her money. I was more worried about her
 being injured that I reached out to other family to see if they could help. They told me grandma was
 fine and that was someone else. 

2. My relative was kidnapped in another country and needs money
 - Didn't happen to me personally, but I've heard of this one. This is where they will trick an 
 older relative into thinking they are traveling and in need of money - either car accident, stolen 
 wallet, etc. 

X. Remedies - adjust the visibility of your Friend's list to only Friends, even then just Mutual Friends

 - Test dash line
