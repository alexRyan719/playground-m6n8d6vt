# Seen in the Wild

These are some examples of malicious activity that I have seen "in the wild". Most of these either 
happened to me, happened to someone I know, or I saw explained somewhere. 

# Facebook

1. My grandma friended me again with a second account using the same picture.
 - Bad actors will copy a profile picture and name to try and friend the victim's friends. They may
 slightly alter the profile picture to not be screened as using the same exact picture. 

 - "She" said she was in a car accident and needed me to send her money. I was more worried about her
 being injured that I reached out to other family to see if they could help. They told me grandma was
 fine and that was someone else. 

2. My relative was kidnapped in another country and needs money
 - Didn't happen to me personally, but I've heard of this one. This is where they will trick an 
 older relative into thinking they are traveling and in need of money - either car accident, stolen 
 wallet, etc.

1. A lottery winner reached out to gift me money
 - Even having just finished a 6 month cyber security boot camp, I still somewhat fell for this. 
 I thought to myself "If I had won the lottery, how would I randomly hook people".
 - I was about 60-80% sure this was a scam. But that 20-40%. 
 - They sent me a picture of a FedEx driver, the name of the driver, the ID of the driver, and the 
 whole time I'm wondering "why do you care so much about the driver".
 - They wanted to deliver physical bundles of money to me via this driver.

# LinkedIn

1. Someone made a fake profile of a high ranking member of the non profit I work for. That profile sent
connection requests to several, if not all, of our team. I saw this the day before I acted, figured
it looked scammy and ignored it. However, technically, I help manage the IT Security for where I work.

So today, when I realized it was probably something I should head off, I ensured it was a fake profile 
by finding the real profile, which is verified and has 500+ connections. I included links to both 
profiles and sent direct messages to all those involved: the victim the malicious actor was impersonating, 
and the victims that accepted the connection requests. 

2. When I started at this company, someone used LinkedIn (I assume) to find out who the CEO / President
used to be of the company I just hired on at and sent me a text message "from them". I asked the person 
that was training me if it was legit, and he told me "oh no, that used to be the president long ago. That's
a scam."

The reason I think they got my
phone number, and possibly email, is the LinkedIn data breach. 

From Google AI:

"""
Yes, LinkedIn has experienced data breaches in the past where phone numbers were leaked. These leaks, 
which have involved scraping of public profiles and other security incidents, have exposed phone numbers 
along with other personal and professional information such as full names, email addresses, and job titles. 

Details:

Past Leaks:
Several incidents involving the exposure of LinkedIn user data have occurred, with one notable instance in
 2021 where a hacker advertised 700 million profiles for sale on a dark web forum. 

Data Compromised:
The leaked data included full names, email addresses, phone numbers, LinkedIn profile URLs, job titles, 
company information, social media account links, and more. 

Impact on Users:
Leaked phone numbers can be used for malicious activities such as spam calls, phishing attempts, and identity
 theft. 

Recommendations:
Users are advised to be cautious of unsolicited calls or messages and to consider limiting the visibility of 
their phone number on LinkedIn or other public platforms.
