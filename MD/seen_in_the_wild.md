# Seen in the Wild

These are some examples of malicious activity that I have seen "in the wild". Most of these either 
happened to me, happened to someone I know, or I saw explained somewhere. 

# General Cyber Attack Concepts

1. Steal your login information

The best way to trick your family and friends is to pretend to be you. Your connections are more 
willing to give you money based on how well you know them. When a malicious actor steals your 
login credentials to a social media account, they are riding your coattails of your social status
to manipulate and steal either information (including other victims) or money / gift cards. 

This is often done by a malicious link that will send you to a fake login website built to look
just like the real login website. 

I've also seen spam emails with Google Docs, Google Sheets, Google Forms, or some other way of
entering a username and password combination and they ask you to provide your login credentials. 
This is usually from a spoofed email meant to look like a school or workplace where you might 
have login credentials to. 

2. Trick you into paying to send you money

I've seen this a couple ways. The first is the Nigerian Prince scam where a Nigerian Prince had
his assets frozen and needed money. There was a promise of much more money to be paid back once
the prince had his assets unfrozen. 

That's the really popular scam, but the one I've seen I detail further down as the X App "Lottery 
winner". That scammer was trying to convince me that I needed to send money to pay for a FedEx
driver to deliver me a package of physical money. Right away, I knew it was weird to not just 
wire money digitally. Anytime someone asks for something before they give you something, you
need to be sure that they'll actually give you that something. 

# Facebook

1. My grandma friended me again with a second account using the same picture.
 - Bad actors will copy a profile picture and name to try and friend the victim's friends. They may
 slightly alter the profile picture to not be screened as using the same exact picture. 

 - "She" said she was in a car accident and needed me to send her money. I was more worried about her
 being injured that I reached out to other family to see if they could help. They told me grandma was
 fine and that was someone else. 

2. My relative was kidnapped in another country and needs money
 - Didn't happen to me personally, but I've heard of this one. This is where they will trick an 
 older relative into thinking they are traveling and in need of money - either car accident, stolen 
 wallet, etc. 

X. Remedies - adjust the visibility of your Friend's list to only Friends, even then just Mutual Friends


 
# X app | Twitter

1. A lottery winner reached out to gift me money
 - Even having just finished a 6 month cyber security boot camp, I still somewhat fell for this. 
 I thought to myself "If I had won the lottery, how would I randomly hook people".
 - I was about 60-80% sure this was a scam. But that 20-40%. 
 - They sent me a picture of a FedEx driver, the name of the driver, the ID of the driver, and the 
 whole time I'm wondering "why do you care so much about the driver".
 - They wanted to deliver physical bundles of money to me via this driver. 

# Phone Call

# LinkedIn

1. Someone made a fake profile of a high ranking member of the non profit I work for. That profile sent
connection requests to several, if not all, of our team. I saw this the day before I acted, figured
it looked scammy and ignored it. However, technically, I help manage the IT Security for where I work.

So today, when I realized it was probably something I should head off, I ensured it was a fake profile 
by finding the real profile, which is verified and has 500+ connections. I included links to both 
profiles and sent direct messages to all those involved: the victim the malicious actor was impersonating, 
and the victims that accepted the connection requests. 

2. When I started at this company, someone used LinkedIn (I assume) to find out who the CEO / President
used to be of the company I just hired on at and sent me a text message "from them". I asked the person 
that was training me if it was legit, and he told me "oh no, that used to be the president long ago. That's
a scam."

The reason I think they got my
phone number, and possibly email, is the LinkedIn data breach. 

From Google AI:

"""
Yes, LinkedIn has experienced data breaches in the past where phone numbers were leaked. These leaks, 
which have involved scraping of public profiles and other security incidents, have exposed phone numbers 
along with other personal and professional information such as full names, email addresses, and job titles. 

Details:

Past Leaks:
Several incidents involving the exposure of LinkedIn user data have occurred, with one notable instance in
 2021 where a hacker advertised 700 million profiles for sale on a dark web forum. 

Data Compromised:
The leaked data included full names, email addresses, phone numbers, LinkedIn profile URLs, job titles, 
company information, social media account links, and more. 

Impact on Users:
Leaked phone numbers can be used for malicious activities such as spam calls, phishing attempts, and identity
 theft. 

Recommendations:
Users are advised to be cautious of unsolicited calls or messages and to consider limiting the visibility of 
their phone number on LinkedIn or other public platforms.

# OnlyFans

1. I have a free subscription to a lady that makes content on there. I was contacted by someone pretending to 
be her on Facebook. I looked her up and found her real Facebook profile, which had the same image for the 
profile picture as this fake account. I told the fake account I know they are fake as she would just talk to
me with her real profile. The fake account said "oh no, this is my private account."

The way that these services work is the content creator would only use their established social media accounts
to conduct business. There is no reason to make "a private account" and talk with fans or customers. Period. 
I told the fake account that when I find them, I'm not going to go easy on them. Maybe even physical violence. 
She continued to argue, so I reported the fake profile and sent a DM to the real artist saying that I had
a fake profile contact me. 

2. I had a fake OF account try to get me to subscribe to what looked like a OF account that was using other 
people's content. The description and aspects about it seemed like it was managed by an Indian company that
just had a bunch of content of women that didn't work there. I reported this profile as well, as the "person"
that was pretending to try and sell me content wasn't able to prove their identity. I asked for this "woman"
to send me a picture with "a-Rye" written on her. "She" sent me a poorly photoshopped image of the text
"a-Rye"...typed and with a color filled background that they tried to match her skin tone with. "She" was a 
darker skinned lady and the color box that the text was in wasn't a perfect match. This was laughably horrible
of a job trying to pose as someone else. AKA Catfishing. The "lady" also tried to do it with a coffee cup by 
buying a coffee somewhere and photoshopping my alias of "a-Rye" on the coffee cup. I just stopped responding
and reported the OF profile and explained that I think that profile was stealing content from other creators.
