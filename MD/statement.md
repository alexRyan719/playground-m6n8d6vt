# Welcome to Cyber Security Basics!

This is brief guide to a list of Cyber Security Best Practices and examples of threats seen "in the wild".

# Passwords

Passwords are no longer sufficient security for any sensitive account. You need to add Multi Factor 
Authentication. 


# Never Give Out Too Much Information 

Be cautious and suspicious if people, places, or services are asking for information. Use your best
judgement as false positives can get annoying and innapropriate. 

# Try Not to Get Too Much Information 

Be mindful of what you're asking of people, especially in industry. Or what you're saying in public
and who can hear it. 

For example, if your friend moved houses, you wouldn't ask this in this way at a busy train station:
"Hey, how are you liking your new place at 123 Charleston Street?"

# Zero Trust Mentality

This means that, even if certain circumstances are met, don't automatically bypass security protocols.
