# Welcome to Cyber Security Basics!

This is a brief guide to a list of Cyber Security Best Practices and examples of threats seen "in the wild".

# Passwords

Passwords are no longer sufficient security for any sensitive account. You need to add Multi Factor 
Authentication. 

You should still use upper case, lower case, special characters, and numbers in your passwords. No two 
passwords should be exactly the same, although you can follow the same schema or pattern with some 
unique added or altered part to keep the end resulting passwords different.

Example:

For your Google password:

googlE123!@#123!@#

This lists the service, has an uppercase character at the end of the service name, has numbers as 123,
then the corresponding special characters of (for Windows) Shift + 123 respectively. I repeated only 
the digits and special characters as I wanted to add some extra characters, but keep less typing by
not doubling the service name. 

For your YouTube password:
youtubE123!@#123!@#

So, this is a pretty secure schema, but if a hacker or malicious person discovered one or more of these
passwords, it's pretty easy to see what the patter / schema is. They would try to apply the same tactics
to your other passwords. 

A more secure and less straightforward pattern / schema is to take a song lyric or phrase that is 
important to you, yet easy to remember, and take the first letter of each word. Still add other number
and special character patterns. You could also add the length of the service name to the end.

For your YouTube password using Never Going To Give You Up
ngtgyU123!@#123!@#7

A bit more painful, but definitely more secure patter would be to use the LAST letter of every word
of a phrase or song lyric.

For your Google password using Never Going To Give You Up
rgoeuP123!@#123!@#6


For your YouTube password using Never Going To Give You Up
rgoeuP123!@#123!@#7

Something much less cumbersome, yet more secure, would be to alter whether you capitalize the first 
or last letter based on if the length of the service name is even or odd. 

For your Google password using Never Going To Give You Up
Ngtgyu123!@#123!@#6


For your YouTube password using Never Going To Give You Up
ngtgyU123!@#123!@#7

These are just some examples of ways that you can ensure that your passwords are harder to guess. You
still need strong Multi Factor Authenticaton. The point of complex passwords is to force a malicious
actor or service to guess many times, which in turn should trigger detection tools. 


# Never Give Out Too Much Information 

Be cautious and suspicious if people, places, or services are asking for information. Use your best
judgement as false positives can get annoying and innapropriate. 

# Try Not to Get Too Much Information 

Be mindful of what you're asking of people, especially in industry. Or what you're saying in public
and who can hear it. 

For example, if your friend moved houses, you wouldn't ask this in this way at a busy train station:
"Hey, how are you liking your new place at 123 Charleston Street?"

# Zero Trust Mentality

This means that, even if certain circumstances are met, don't automatically bypass security protocols.
